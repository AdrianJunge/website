# TL;DR<a id="TL;DR"></a>
    **- Challenge Setup:** **Flask** app hosting an Anime chat where you can text with a simple chat bot
    **- Key Discoveries:** **Flask** `Debug` is enabled
    **- Vulnerability:** Free arbitrary file read
    **- Exploitation:** We can calculate the **Flask** console PIN via the file read and bypass the simple console access filter by spoofing the `Host` header

# 1. Introduction<a id="introduction"></a>
Having a look at the frontend of the website some anime character named `Hatsune Miku` introduces herself and we can have a chat with her:

![mitsune-miku](ctf/writeups/sekaictf/myflaskapp/miku_chat.png "mitsune-miku")

The buttons will always move to another location on the webpage as soon as you try to click them. Even when you are fast enough, nothing seems to happen, so lets have a look at the source code.

# 2. Reconnaissance<a id="reconnaissance"></a>
The challenge serves a basic **Python Flask** app. The `/` path just serves the **Miku chat** which is not interesting for us according to the comment in the **JavaScript** code:

```javascript
// Dont bother analyzing this code, this is not part of the challenge :D

class MikuChat {
    ...
```

However the is a second path `/view` which just gives back every file content requested via the `filename` query parameter - there is absolutely no filtering and sanitization going on. So you might just think we can immediately read out the flag but unfortunately the file name is randomized in the **Dockerfile**:

```Dockerfile
RUN mv flag.txt /flag-$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1).txt
```

Also at the end of the **Flask** source code is written:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

So the `debug` flag is enabled, which will become highly interesting for us.

# 3. Vulnerability Description<a id="vulnerability description"></a>
Serving your **Flask** app with `debug` enabled comes with its own risks. For this reason there is even a warning message when starting the **Flask** server with `debug` mode enabled:

```text
flask-app-1  |  * Serving Flask app 'app'
flask-app-1  |  * Debug mode: on
flask-app-1  | WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
flask-app-1  |  * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
flask-app-1  |  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

flask-app-1  |  * Restarting with stat
flask-app-1  |  * Debugger is active!
flask-app-1  |  * Debugger PIN: 701-065-558
```

Also the debugger PIN is shown on the console which is needed to execute arbitrary **Python** code at the `/console` path for debugging purposes. So this might be our way to get the flag. We have to achieve RCE as we don't know the file name of the flag and as far as I know there is no way to obtain the file name of any file just via plain file read on **Linux**.

# 4. Exploitation<a id="exploitation"></a>
## 4.1. Exploitation Variant 1 - Calculating the PIN<a id="calculating the pin"></a>
Fortunately there are already blogs like [this](https://b33pl0g1c.medium.com/hacking-the-debugging-pin-of-a-flask-application-7364794c4948) describing how to obtain the debugger PIN just with plain file read. Basically you need a couple of "probably public" information like the username running the **Flask** server, the **Flask** app path and some more. You also need some private bits which can't be guessed as these are generated with secure randomness. But each of the private bits can be easily read out by our arbitrary file read. According to the [debug source code](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/3.1.3/src/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py) of **werkzeug**, which is the underlying web server of **Flask**, we just need the content of `/sys/class/net/eth0/address` and `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` to calculate the debugger PIN.

Accessing the `/console` on local works like a charm. Unfortunately this is different on remote, as we just get a `400 Bad Request`. This is weird, there shouldn't be anything different on remote. After searching for a while a team mate found [the following](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/debug/#allowed-hosts) in the **Flask** documentation. According to this only trusted hosts like `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are allowed to access the `console` endpoint. Having a look in to the [source code](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/3.1.3/src/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py#L455) we find the `check_host_trust` method. This is called everytime something happens on the `/console` endpoint like accessing the endpoint, submitting the debugger PIN or executing some **Python** code on it. We can see that `HTTP_HOST` is checked against the whitelist which is just the plain **HTTP Host** header. Although the **HTTP Host** header seems in general redundant as on the transportation layer of the ISO/OSI model it is already clear which host is requested, it is used in some specific scenarios where the same server serves multiple different domains. But for our challenge the **HTTP Host** header is irrelevant for the connection. So what happens if we just spoof the `Host` header to be `localhost` for example manually in **Burp Suite** or by hardcoding the **HTTP Host** header for the **Python** `requests` module? Indeed now we are able to access the `/console` and put in the debugger PIN. Now we just need some **Python** code to obtain the flag:

```python
import glob; [print(f"{f}: {open(f).read().strip()}") for f in glob.glob("/flag*")]
```

## 4.2. Exploitation Variant 1 - 🧀<a id="cheese"></a>
There was even a much more simpler way to obtain the content of the flag file. By retrieving the contents of `/proc/mounts` by visiting `/view?filename=/proc/mounts`, we obtain the full flag file name. The reason for this is that the flag file is not just simply copied but bind-mounted into the container. The **Linux** kernel has to keep track of all of the mounted directory and files and lists these in `/proc/mounts`. So now we can simply retrieve the flag via `/view?filename=/flag-<random>.txt`.
